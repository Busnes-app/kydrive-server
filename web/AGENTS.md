# Web

## Purpose
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite PWA frontend embedding KySecurity color tokens (Busnes light/dark defaults plus `Patina Ky`, `Cyber`, `Nord`, `Paper`, `OLED`), 90-second ephemeral QR device pairing modals, client-side WebCrypto PoW CAPTCHA, and administrative management panels.

## Ownership
Owns user interface components, service worker caching, PWA installation manifests, and frontend theme switching.

## Local Contracts
- Web themes default to the Busnes.app cream/light and charcoal/dark palettes with orange accents, following the OS until a browser-local choice is saved. Preserve existing named themes and saved choices.
- A signed-in user with `must_change_password` sees only password replacement and sign-out. Replacement uses `secureFetch`, returns to login after session revocation, and never exposes the normal navigation before completion.
- Strict TypeScript type safety without unused imports.
- The authenticated shell uses a persistent sidebar; the selected page is marked by a quiet surface and slim accent rail, with a horizontal overflow navigation on small screens.
- Dynamic theme selection applies `data-theme` attribute to the root HTML document and persists to `localStorage`.
- Authenticated state-changing requests use `secureFetch` so the `ky_csrf` cookie is mirrored into `X-CSRF-Token`.
- Register the service worker from the production JS bundle; keep `script-src 'self'` intact. Pairing uses a native modal dialog for focus containment, Escape and focus restoration.
- Worker caching is limited to the same-origin public shell, manifest and assets. HTML is network-first with offline fallback so deployments refresh; dynamic/auth routes stay uncached.
- KyDrive deployments use SQLite; inherited recovery UI still reports snapshot preconditions.
- The suite SSO button reads `Sign On with KyIdentity`; the login description identifies organization files and shared workspaces.

- KyDrive owns files, folders, versions/trash, workspace permissions/quotas and operational status/audit. People/group management links to KyIdentity; no separate local directory editor.
- Hide privileged navigation from staff. Directory-managed group membership and workspace access are distinct. Managers can configure group grants; only administrators set quota or see global operations.

## Verification
- Browser setup: build the frontend, run `go build -o .browser/server ./cmd/server` at the repo root, then `cd web && npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:browser`. CI also installs browser OS dependencies.
- `make test-web` or `cd web && npm ci && npm test`, then `npm run build` (vitest with jsdom; `src/pages/Backup.test.tsx` renders the recovery screen against a stubbed status route). Commit `web/dist` after a build; CI diffs it.

## Shared browser UI

- `src/ky-ui/` is generated from Busnes-app/ky-ui, pinned by `VERSION` file hashes. Change shared colors, navigation states and storage helpers upstream, then run its consumer sync with an explicit worktree map; do not hand-edit vendored files.
- Products own layout, routes, saved choice keys and named palettes. Busnes aliases consume shared tokens; mark primary navigation with `ky-nav-item` while preserving current-page semantics.
- Verify vendored files with `node src/ky-ui/check-vendor.mjs` from this document's directory. Builds/CI run that check. Rendered evidence and capture limitations are recorded in the repository-root `UI-VERIFICATION.md`.

## Child DOX Index
- [browser/AGENTS.md](./browser/AGENTS.md): Production-server browser regression harness and disposable test data.
